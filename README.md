<h1>Business 310 (Data Science/Decision Science) Project</h1>
<h2>By Keanu Valencia</h2>

<p>This Repository will be used to document my work for my first BUS 310 Project.</p>

<p>September 11, 2024, to September 15, 2024</p>
<P>For this project, I will create a few graphs in Python to gain a better understanding of the data set. I will create Histograms or Box-and-whiskers plots to understand the spread of the data (measures of dispersion) and sctterplots to identity outliers. The end goal is to put all the graphs into a presentation.</P>
